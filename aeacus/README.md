Welcome to Aeacus!

Aeacus is a Python package designed to tackle the growing problem of fraud in the digital world. Named after the Greek god of justice, Aeacus aims to provide a reliable and efficient solution for classifying digital transactions into fraud or legitimate classes.

In Greek mythology, Oenone was an oread nymph who lived on Mount Ida. Her tragic story of abandonment and betrayal serves as a cautionary tale of the consequences of ignoring warning signs. Similarly, in the digital world, fraud can cause irreparable damage if left undetected.

With Aeacus, you can trust that your transactions will be carefully analyzed and classified with the utmost accuracy. Our package utilizes advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques to identify potential fraud and protect your business from financial loss.

We hope that Aeacus will become an essential tool for businesses of all sizes, allowing them to conduct transactions with confidence and security.
